						<h1>Summer Trip</h1>
						<p>Last summer, my mom and dad took me and <span id="person"></span> on a trip to <span id="location"></span>. The weather there is very <span id="weather"></span>! Many people also go to <span id="secondLocation"></span> to <span id="activity"></span> or see the <span id="secondActivity"></span>. The people that live there love to eat <span id="food"></span> and are very proud of their big <span id="secondFood"></span>. They also like to <span id="thirdActivity"></span> in the sun and swim in the <span id="fourthActivity"></span>! It was a really <span id="feeling"></span> trip!</p>
